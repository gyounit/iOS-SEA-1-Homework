## Homework

Welcome to the homework repository for iOS-SEA-1!<br/><br/>

# If this is your first time here:
1. Clone the repository locally with Github Desktop. The default destination is your Documents directory. <br/>
2. Once you have the repo cloned, make your own branch. Click the Add a branch button (just to the left of the branch name - should be 'master' at first).<br/>
3. Name your branch after yourself.<br/>
4. Commit to your branch freely. I can help with any git issues you have via Slack.<br/>
